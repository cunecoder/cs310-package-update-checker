1. How did you get the list of packages?
    I ran apt list --upgradable and used the python subprocess function with
    capture_output and text as True to save the list to a python variable.

2. What is the crontab sequence to run the script?
    I used '0 8 * * 1 /mnt/c/Users/david/cs310/cs310-package-update-checker/pkg-check.py'
    to run the script every Monday at 8am.

3. Since this script would require root, how do you install a crontab for root?
    You would just add word sudo in front the word crontab any time you use it.
